## Notes

- Sharing recipient is person or group with whom a resource is being shared.
- In a later release, we will offer a “Sites” data set which can be joined to this “Sharing” data set by Site Id. In the meantime, ItemURL is offered to help understand where the item is being shared.  
- The “Shared With Count” property is useful if you decide to exclude the “Shared With” column from the data set for privacy reasons.
